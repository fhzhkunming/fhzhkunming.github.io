# A Diabetes Data Analysis and Prediction Journey
I recently collaborated with my project partner on an engaging project focused on diabetes data analysis and prediction modeling. Utilizing a dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset/), we delved into exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling to gain insights into diabetes outcomes. The primary target variable, Diabetes_binary, served as a crucial indicator, distinguishing 0 for no diabetes and 1 for prediabetes or diabetes. Key predictors included High blood pressure, High cholesterol, BMI, Smoker, Fruits, Veggies, and Age.
## Exploratory Data Analysis 
Our journey started with a thorough EDA, including basic statistics, visualizations of key predictors, correlations between numeric variables, and contingency tables for categorical predictors. This foundational step allowed us to understand the dataset deeper and paved the way for informed decision-making throughout the project.
## Data Split and Model Training
To ensure the robustness of our models, we strategically split the dataset into 70% training and 30% test subsets based on educational levels. These levels included some elementary, some high school, high school, some college, and college. Six distinct models, namely Logistic Regression, LASSO Logistic Regression, Classification Tree, Random Forest, Partial Least Squares, and Regularized Logistic Regression, were carefully trained and evaluated using log loss as a metric.
## Challenges Faced
Reflecting on the project, I acknowledge that effective communication is key to a successful collaboration. Working on different aspects of the project concurrently with my partner was beneficial, but it also presented challenges, especially during the GitHub update process. Committing and pushing updates frequently is crucial, and I have learned the importance of clear communication with my project partner to avoid committing conflicts and streamline the collaborative process.
## Key Takeaways
This project served as a valuable learning experience in collaborative work using GitHub. Committing and pushing updates frequently, along with proactive communication with my partner about tasks and updates, emerged as critical practices. The experience underscored the efficiency of working on different parts of a project simultaneously, harnessing diverse ideas to enhance the final product.
## Future Improvements
If given the opportunity to approach a similar project again, I would emphasize even more frequent communication with my project partner. Clearly defining tasks and areas of responsibility would mitigate conflicts during the GitHub update process and contribute to a smoother collaboration.
## Summary
To sum up, this diabetes data analysis and prediction modeling project not only offered insights into health indicators but also provided valuable lessons in effective collaboration and project management.
