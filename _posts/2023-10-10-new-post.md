## Navigating APIs with R: A Vignette Project 
### **Introduction**  
I recently completed an R project focused on the exploration of interacting with APIs. This endeavor was an exciting journey in which I learned to access and analyze data from an API. To illustrate the process, I chose to work with the Teleport API. This robust system provides an up-to-date quality of life database for our planet, encompassing data from over 300 diverse dimensions sourced from more than 70 different providers. Throughout this project, I delved into several API endpoints.  
### **Process**  
The project commenced with the installation of essential packages and the loading of requisite libraries. I then embarked on developing functions to query specific endpoints. These endpoints encompassed diverse aspects, including median salaries across different countries, cities, and job titles. Additionally, I explored quality of life scores for 18 US cities, assessing various categories such as housing, cost of living, safety, education, environmental quality, and more. To document the entire process comprehensively, I utilized an R Markdown file. This file contains a wealth of information, including functions, data tidying processes, tables, and figures showcasing the results.  
## **Major findings**    
My exploration of the Teleport API unveiled some fascinating insights: 

**1.** Global Median Salaries: Among the 50 countries examined, Switzerland emerged as the leader in median salary, followed by Denmark and the United States. Norway secured the fourth spot. The remaining countries in the top 10 included Australia, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Israel, Canada, and Sweden. Conversely, the countries with the lowest median salaries were Vietnam, Indonesia, Greece, Russia, Portugal, Mexico, Hungary, India, Poland, and Czechia.  

**2.** High- and Low-Paying Jobs: The top five highest-paying jobs, both worldwide and within the United States, included C Level Executive, Physician, Finance Manager, and Dentist. In contrast, the bottom five lowest-paying jobs were Cashier, Waiter, Receptionist, Administrative Assistant, and Graphic Designer.    

**3.** City Quality of Life: An analysis of life quality scores across 18 US cities revealed that Boston, New York, Raleigh, Salt Lake City, and Madison ranked as the top destinations. These cities scored notably high in living standards, education, environment, and other factors.   
These insights offer valuable information for individuals seeking to explore other countries, make informed career choices, or plan a move to a new location. I hope you find this vignette project both engaging and informative.  
### **Summary**  
This project not only deepened my understanding of developing R functions to interact with APIs but also presented a host of challenges that required creative troubleshooting. Despite investing considerable time to overcome these obstacles, the knowledge, and skills I acquired in R programming proved to be a rewarding outcome. The effort and dedication paid off, motivating me to further enhance my R programming skills in future projects.
